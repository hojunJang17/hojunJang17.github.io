I'm a Ph.D. student at Seoul National University, fortunate to be under guidance of Professor [Young Min Kim](https://3d.snu.ac.kr/members/).
My primary research focus heads to **Human Motion** and diverse **Motion Sensors**.
I really enjoy exploring challenging problems about human motion and interactions.
